		<p>GeForce Infinity is a next-gen application designed to enhance the GeForce NOW experience. Originally created to address the lack of native GeForce NOW support on Linux, this app also provides functionality for Windows users. My goal is to refine the user interface and offer custom features for an improved experience.</p>
        <p>Key features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>üöÄ Native-like performance</li>
			<li>üíª Up to 1440p support</li>
			<li>üéû Up to 120 FPS support</li>
            <li>üíé Modern SteamOS-like sidebar for controlling GeForce Infinity (Ctrl+I)</li>
            <li>üåê Discord Rich Presence</li>
            <li>üéØ Autofocus when gaming rig is ready</li>
            <li>üîî Notifications when gaming rig is ready</li>
            <li>üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Ability to change UserAgent if having issues with defaults</li>
            <li>üé® Ability to change theme colors of GeForce NOW</li>

            <description>
                <p>After a long time of abandoning this project I recently came back to it, thanks to the people who starred and forked my repo! I noticed a bit late but it gave me a huge motivation boost and now after some big changes I feel like version 1.0.0 is ready!</p>
                <p>As it is 1.0.0 it will have bugs and is nowhere near finished, but it has its core functionalities working.</p>
                <p>The .exe and .zip files are for Windows; the rest are for Linux.</p>
